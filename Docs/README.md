# SpriteKit Spinning Prize Wheel 2

SpriteKit Spinning prize wheel

![Orange Think Box presents: SpinWheel](Docs/example.gif)


SpriteKit Prize Wheel is a physics based spinning prize wheel with a real moving peg flapper to create an awesome looking effect. You can have your users drag on the wheel to control how to much to spin just like a real prize wheel or have your users push the spin button in the center of the wheel to spin the wheel. Use it to reward your users with daily prizes, trivia games, control chance situations or for gambling type games.

## SKControlSprite Install Instructions

copy the SpinWheel folder into your project

Your scene must conform to SKPhysicsContactDelegate

    class GameScene: SKScene, SKPhysicsContactDelegate {

        private var spinWheelOpen = false
        
        override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
            self.physicsWorld.contactDelegate = self
        }
    }

In your scene to open a copy of the SpinWheel 

    func displaySpinWheel() {
        let spinWheel = SpinWheel(size: self.size)
        spinWheel.zPosition = 500
        addChild(spinWheel)

        //must be after the addChild
        spinWheel.initPhysicsJoints()

        spinWheelOpen = true
    }
    
    func didBegin(_ contact: SKPhysicsContact) {
    
        if spinWheelOpen {
            spinWheel.didBegin(contact)
        }
    }
    
    override func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval) {
    
        if spinWheelOpen {
            spinWheel.updateWheel(currentTime)
        }
    }

## Settings.swift

Inside of Settings.swift you can change the font or how the Spin Wheel is interacted with. Settings also has the physics category declarations.

    let kGameFont: String = "Context Rounded Black SSi"

    //if you don't want the center hub to act like a spin button change this to false
    var kHubSpinsWheel = true

    //if you don't want the user to be able to swipe to spin the wheel change this to false
    var kCanSwipeToSpinWheel = true

## To Change values on the Spin Wheel

Inside of SpinWheel.swift change the first 3 values for each array in the slots array

    //[prizeTitle that displays when won, icon image, value of items one in String format, start angle (do not change), end angle (do not change)]
    slots = [
        ["40 coins", "wheel_prize_coin", "40", "0", "44"]
    ]
    
## To receive winnings
    
Inside of SpinWheel.swift check in won(prizeTitle: String) for the same prizeTitle as in the slots array and handle it accordingly

    func won(prizeTitle: String) {
    
        if prizeTitle == "a present" {
            //they've won a prize so do something with the it
        }
        else if prizeTitle.hasSuffix("coins")  {
            //they've won coins so do something with the coins
        }
    }
